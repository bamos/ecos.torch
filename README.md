# Introduction to ECOS

**Visit http://www.embotech.com/ECOS for detailed information on ECOS.**

ECOS is a numerical software for solving convex second-order cone programs (SOCPs) of type

```
min  c'*x
s.t. A*x = b
G*x <=_K h
```

where the last inequality is generalized, i.e. `h - G*x` belongs to the cone `K`.
ECOS supports the positive orthant `R_+`, second-order cones `Q_n` defined as
```
Q_n = { (t,x) | t >= || x ||_2 }
```
with t a scalar and `x` in `R_{n-1}`,
and the exponential cone `K_e` defined as

```
K_e = closure{(x,y,z) | exp(x/z) <= y/z, z>0}
```

where `(x,y,z)` is in `R_3`.
The cone `K` is therefore a direct product of the positive orthant,
second-order, and exponential cones:

```
K = R_+ x Q_n1 x ... x Q_nN x K_e x ... x K_e
```

# This Library

This repository provides unofficial [Torch](http://torch.ch/) bindings to
the [ECOS C API](https://www.embotech.com/ECOS/How-to-use/C-API).

# Setup

After [setting up Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html),
this library can be installed with:

```bash
luarocks install https://github.com/bamos/ecos.torch/raw/master/ecos-scm-1.rockspec
```

or equivalently:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bamos/ecos.torch.git --recursive
cd ecos.torch
luarocks make
```

# Usage

## Linear Program

```lua
local ecos = require 'ecos'

local G = torch.Tensor{{-1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {0, -1}, {1, -2}}
local h = torch.Tensor{1.0, -2.0, 0.0, 4.0}
local c = torch.Tensor{2.0, 1.0}

local status, x = ecos.solve{c=c, G=G, h=h}
print(x) -- Optimal x is [0.5, 1.5]
```

# Tests

After installing the library with `luarocks`, our tests in
[test.lua](https://github.com/bamos/ecos.torch/blob/master/test.lua)
can be run with `th test.lua`.

# Issues and Roadmap

1. While this is working well for linear programs, I am not using
   and have not tested the second-order or exponential cones.
   Please comment in
   [Issue 1](https://github.com/bamos/ecos.torch/issues/1)
   if you are interested in using these.
2. ECOS uses a sparse matrix format and the code current converts
   a dense Torch tensor to a sparse array in C in every call.
   This could potentially be optimized by using sparse Torch
   tensors and doing the conversion in Torch.
   Then the user could then optionally maintain sparse
   Tensors in Torch.
   Please comment in
   [Issue 2](https://github.com/bamos/ecos.torch/issues/2)
   if you are interested in this.
